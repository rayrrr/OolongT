		},
		{
			"text": "Probably his best known is called “Jabberwocky,” with its opening line of “’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves…”, and its many invented words, some that have now entered the English language, such as “chortle” and “galumph”."
		},

			"text": "Such nonsense verse is as popular now as it was when first published."
		},
		{
			"text": "His more serious poetry, it must be admitted, is generally inferior to his humorous verse and often over sentimental."

		{
			"text": "It is an epic nonsense poem written at a time when Carroll was struggling with his religious beliefs following the serious illness of his cousin and godson, Charlie Wilcox, who eventually died from tuberculosis."
		},
		{
			"text": "Although the poem concerns death and danger, it is filled with humour and whimsical ideas."
		},

		},
		{
			"text": "After a night nursing his cousin, Carroll went for a long walk over the hills near Guildford, and a solitary line of verse came into his head – “For the Snark was a Boojum, you see!” The rest of the stanza, the last in the poem, came to him a few days later."
		},
		{
			"text": "Over a period of six months, the rest of poem was composed, ending up as 141 stanzas in 8 sections that Carroll called “fits."

			"text": "The question that naturally arises is “does the poem have a meaning?” Carroll denied that he meant anything in particular – the poem was all nonsense – but that did not stop people asking him, and it inspired others to give it their own meaning."
		},
		{
			"text": "To some extent, the poem is about the relationships that emerge among the crew, and the interaction between this motley bunch of characters."
		},
		{
			"text": "All behave in odd ways, some have close-shaves, and one completely vanishes – caught by a Boojum."
		},
		{
			"text": "The poem was entitled The Hunting of the Snark with the subtitle, An Agony in Eight Fits."
		},
		{
			"text": "Carroll originally intended it as a set of verses to be included in another of his children’s stories, but it grew too long and became a book in its own right."

		{
			"text": "He drew nine illustrations for the book; a tenth illustration depicting a Snark was rejected by Carroll – he wanted the creature to remain unimaginable."
		},
		{
			"text": "The poem owes a debt to “Jabberwocky” – some of the invented words from these verses reappear in The Hunting of the Snark and Carroll explains their derivation in his Preface, such as frumious being a portmanteau word based on “fuming” and “furious."
		},
		{
